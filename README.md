# argocd

ArgoCD configuration for personal k8s clusters.  Self-synchronizing using kustomize and its Helm chart inflator generator.

See github.com/eknudtson/apps-cd for the app-of-apps repo deploying appsets for all other components.

This is currently limited to a single Raspberry Pi running k3s, but I may expand this to a full HA cluster in the future.
